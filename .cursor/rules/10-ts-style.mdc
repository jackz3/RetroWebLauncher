# TypeScript/React Coding Standards

- Always use explicit types for exported APIs and function signatures.
- Prefer meaningful, descriptive names (avoid 1â€“2 character identifiers).
- Use guard clauses and handle edge cases early; avoid deep nesting.
- Do not catch errors without meaningful handling.
- Match existing formatting; avoid unrelated reformatting in edits.
- Keep comments focused on "why" rather than "how".
- Avoid `any`; prefer precise types. Never use unsafe casts.
- Ensure no linter errors; run checks after edits.
- In React components, keep props typed and avoid inline anonymous functions in hot paths.
- Use multi-line for complex logic; keep lines readable.
