# Communication and Code Citation

- Keep messages concise and skimmable; use `###` headings and bullet lists.
- Format file, directory, function, and class names with backticks.
- Cite existing code using CODE REFERENCES:
  - Syntax:
```
startLine:endLine:filepath
// code here
```
- Show proposed/new code in standard fenced blocks with a language tag.
- Never mix formats; never add line numbers inside code blocks.
- Do not indent triple backticks; place them at column 0.
- Prefer semantic summaries over step-by-step logs unless asked.
